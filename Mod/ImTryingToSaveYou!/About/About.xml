  <description>Overhauls the 1.6 pawn dressing mechanic.
  
  Removes faction penalty when forcing a pawn to wear something.
  
  When dressing a pawn from another faction in apparel that replaces something they're wearing, their apparel is stored in their inventory.
  
  Records what any non-hostile, humanlike pawns that enter the map are wearing so that only their apparel is placed in their inventory. Apparel that was originally yours will be dropped.</description>
